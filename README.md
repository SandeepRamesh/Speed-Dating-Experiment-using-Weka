# Speed-Dating-Experiment-using-Weka
This contains a report of the steps done to predict whether a person will get a match or not depending on his characteristics. I have also done a decision tree classification to give the best characteristics needed in order to get a match. An Arff file has been uploaded for your convenience that was used in Weka to do data mining. This data file is the processed one that is clean of missing values and removed from inconsistencies. 
dataset has been sourced from Kaggle from the link below.
